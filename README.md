**R7. Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.**

There are many online marketplaces that facillitate the buying and selling of cars. These fill the needs of most buyers and sellers. Being someone who has a passion for modified cars, and having gone through the process of selling modified cars on these platforms multiple times, it is clear that the platforms available do not cater well to specialized vehicles.

**R8. Why is it a problem that needs solving?**

As a buyer interested in buying a modified car, it is hard to find what you're looking for on a regular car marketplace. As a seller using these platforms it's impossible to have your listing targeted to a buyer who would be interested in a modified vehicle. It is for this reason that a very little amount of modified car sales take place on popular marketplaces such as Carsales.

Rather, most modified car sales take place inside of particular Facebook groups set up for the buying and selling of modified cars. While this has a one up on a website such as Carsales in terms of targeting the listings to the right people, this platforms lacks in the listings being tailored to cars. Sale posts are just often a big wall of text on a Facebook post with some photos. The listing structure is not tailored to cars as it's just using the Facebook format. 

My marketplace app is called Modified Rides, which provides a much better experience to both buyers and sellers of modified cars, by providing targeted listings for sellers with attributes focused on modifications, and allowing buyers to find exactly what they're looking for.
